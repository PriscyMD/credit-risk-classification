# credit-risk-classification

## An overview of the project and its purpose
### In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1: Part 1: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
### Part 2: Part 2: Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
### Part 2: Part 3: Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code and report.
